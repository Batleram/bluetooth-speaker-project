# Bluetooth speaker project

This is just a quick repo I spun up to showcase my bluetooth speaker project.
This is aggregating all of the bits and pieces I could find on my phone and pc about this project.

Version 1 has very few images since I didn't have a phone back then so sadly a lot of the revisions have no documentation
I also lost a lot of the crossover design files, enclosure design files and the parts I had tried using due to time and lack of care for logging

### Version 1

This folder contains all the remenants of the first design for the speaker. I don't have pictures of the actual version 1, this is more like V1.5.
I have also documented the parts that have gone into the speaker that I could find receipts for.

### Version 2

This has some more images of the build process because I now have a phone and can now take pictures of things I make.
This also contains some .blend files which were my sketching out of how I wanted to build the enclosure. I also used those as build plans for the final design
This design is still being built, so things can and will change over time, I'll try and keep this updated

### Custom pcb design

I wanted at some point to design my custom PCB handling battery charging, bluetooth communications and audio amplification.
This felt cool since having my own microcontroller in it could allow me to add some really powerful features, like games on the speaker itself...
This however never became anything because I found a cheap board that does basically all I need for the speaker at an affordable rate.
I also have no experience with PCB design and finding the proper chips that were available to hobbyists felt impossible

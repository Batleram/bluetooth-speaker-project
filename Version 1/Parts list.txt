Revisions:
Tried multiple bluetooth amp boards:
    - Several chinese bluetooth amp boards (all had too much noise and had other issues)
    - Pre-made 18650 battery pack KAB-BE (had trouble charging, holding charge and was too big, other issues too)
    - Dayton Audio KAB-60M Amplifier board (Used this for the whole lifetime of the speaker after the chinese boards. Only getting replaced now by a better revision of it)
    - Replaced the drivers with some other one I can't find the datasheet for, because the previous ones broke
    - Replaced the tweeters with Dayton Audio ND20FA because I melted through the previous ones while soldering the leads
    - Tried some wool in the case for better acoustics, didn't notice a difference
    - My latching switch broke, and finding a good looking replacement for cheap was difficult, so I made a flip flop circuit making a momentary switch into a latching one
    - Switched to a proper latching switch when I found an affordable one
